## [1.0.3]

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL**: Fixed WorkflowModule.register() returning null instead of WorkflowService instances
- Fixed dependency injection issues preventing ModuleRef and KafkaClient from being properly injected
- Fixed entity service resolution when using class-based EntityService configurations
- Fixed decorator-based actions not being executed due to dependency injection failures
- Fixed test configurations and provider registrations across all test suites
- Improved error handling in entity service methods with proper async/await patterns
- Enhanced entity service resolution during module initialization to prevent runtime errors

### Improved
- Added automatic entity service resolution and caching in onModuleInit()
- Better error messages and fallback handling for entity operations
- Comprehensive test coverage now at 100% (60/60 tests passing)
- Updated all test configurations to properly provide required dependencies

### Notes
- This release fixes critical issues that prevented the library from functioning in v1.0.1-1.0.2
- All users on versions 1.0.1-1.0.2 should upgrade immediately
- No breaking changes - this is a drop-in replacement

## [1.0.1]

### Added
- Comprehensive test cases for complex workflow scenarios
- Stripe subscription workflow example with complete test coverage
- Mock implementations for external dependencies in tests
- Test coverage for all possible state transitions in workflows
- Test cases for error handling and edge cases in workflows

### Changed
- Updated parameter structure for action methods to use `params: { entity: T, payload?: P }` pattern
- Improved type safety in workflow definitions

### Breaking Changes
- Action methods now require a consistent parameter structure of `params: { entity: T, payload?: P }`
- All action handlers must return a Promise of the entity type
- Changed workflow definition property `actions` to `Actions` (capitalized)
- Modified entity service interface to enforce stricter type checking

## [0.0.10] - 2025-03-18

### Added
- Initial release of nestjs-workflow
- Workflow definition interface with support for states, transitions, and events
- Decorator-based approach for defining workflow actions and conditions
- `@OnEvent` decorator for event-triggered actions
- `@OnStatusChanged` decorator with configurable error handling via `failOnError` parameter
- Stateless architecture that maintains state within domain entities
- Kafka integration for event-driven workflows
- Support for inline functions in transitions for actions and conditions
- Class-based approach with decorators for complex workflows
- Entity service interface for workflow state management
